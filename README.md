# stochastic-processes-modeling
This repository contains implementations of fundamental stochastic process models developed as part of a graduate-level Stochastic Processes course.

The project includes:

Poisson process simulation (two different methods)

Character-based Markov chain text generator

Full Hidden Markov Model (HMM) implementation

Baum–Welch (EM algorithm)

Forward–Backward

Viterbi decoding

All algorithms were implemented from scratch in Python.
